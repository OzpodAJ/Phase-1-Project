Welcome!
This is my Flatiron Phase 1 project, a simple messenger room.
Use of this page is very simple:
First, type a username into the username field, located at the top left side of the page.
Then select a color from the dropdown menu, this will determine the color that will be assigned to your username when making posts.
Finally, simply type your desired message to the board in the text field at the bottom of the page and click submit. 
your message will appear in the black box that makes up the center of the webpage.
